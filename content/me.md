# Nash Aiomos

Hi! Lovely guys ~ Nice to meet you. I am introverted, but I also enjoy good friends. 
Geek writer, software engineer, cryptocurrency enthusiast.

I enjoy programming, reading, hiking, running, climbing, and playing video games.

I love blockchain, mainly using Rust and JavaScript to develop smart contracts.
I'm interested in books on science fiction, economics, history, suspense novel, business, and psychology.
Sometimes after being at home for a long time, I just go out and walk around. Or plan a short trip.
I love playing Grand Theft Auto V, Don't Starve, Sid Meier's Civilization VI. But now I am tired of playing, and I look forward to the release of GTA6 soon.
